In this experiment, we applied the DETR (Detection Transformer) model to an original dataset without remapping the annotations to classes 0:5 and without merging the left and right teams. The primary objective was to evaluate the model's performance using the COCO (Common Objects in Context) format, which is suitable for the DETR model. We transformed the dataset from YOLO format to COCO format and investigated the model's ability to differentiate between 7 classes.

Methodology
Dataset Preparation: The original dataset, containing annotations for various classes, was used as-is without any modifications to the class mapping or team merging.

Format Conversion: We converted the dataset from YOLO format to COCO format. The COCO format is well-suited for the DETR model, facilitating seamless integration and evaluation.

DETR Model: We employed the DETR model for object detection on the prepared dataset. The DETR model utilizes a transformer-based architecture, which allows for efficient detection of objects in images.

Results
The results obtained from applying the DETR model to the original dataset were mixed. While the model displayed promising results in detecting objects across the 7 different classes present in the dataset, its performance was not consistently optimal. The model demonstrated the ability to differentiate between the diverse classes and produced satisfactory detection outcomes in some instances. However, it is important to note that the model's performance varied, and it did not consistently achieve high accuracy across all scenarios.



# The approach I've adopted involves several key steps to address the project's objectives and challenges within the given time constraints. Here's an overview of the strategy I'm implementing:

Annotation Remapping and DETR Training: I've taken the initiative to remap the annotations, refining the dataset for the task at hand. Training the DETR model on the revised dataset, which now consists of 6 specific classes, aligns the model more closely with the project's focus.

Integration of Detection and Classification: To create a comprehensive solution, I'm integrating the outputs of the DETR model's detection step with a classification model. This classification model, which is specialized in classifying the left and right teams based on bounding boxes, will be utilized to classify the detected objects.

Deadline-Driven Approach: Given the project's pressing deadline, I'm prioritizing task completion to meet the delivery schedule. While showcasing the integration results is desirable, I acknowledge that time constraints may limit my ability to demonstrate the outcomes within the given timeframe.

Future Steps and Improvements: While the current approach addresses the immediate objectives, I recognize that the project has potential for further refinement. Future steps may include conducting thorough testing, implementing fine-tuning measures, and addressing challenges that have yet to be fully explored.

Addressing Class Imbalance: I am aware of the class imbalance within the dataset, and I plan to enhance the model's performance by applying data augmentation techniques to specific classes. This approach aims to mitigate the impact of imbalanced class distribution on model effectiveness.

Remaining Challenges: The project poses various challenges that warrant consideration, such as integration complexities, potential fine-tuning opportunities, and the need for optimization. While these aspects may not all be addressed in the current timeframe, they remain important considerations for future project iterations.

In conclusion, I'm diligently working to align the project's approach with its goals, taking into account the time constraints and challenges at hand. The evolving nature of the project necessitates a strategic and focused effort, prioritizing the most impactful tasks to ensure a functional and valuable outcome within the stipulated timeline.
